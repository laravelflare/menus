# Roadmap
The Roadmap aims to provide a list of future features and functionality that can be expected to appear in Flare. Think of it as a reverse [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md), where items closest to the current date are soon to be released, whereas items furthest from the future are proposed enhancements with less overall clarity which will be added to as we move toward them.
